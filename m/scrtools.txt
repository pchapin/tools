                                 Introduction
                                 ------------

          The functions  in this package are designed to suplement those in
     the SCR package. These functions are  at a  slightly higher  level and
     are more specialized. These functions depend on SCR, and only SCR, for
     all the  low  level  I/O.  These  functions  could  be  ported  to any
     environment provided SCR.C was adjusted.


                                   Features
                                   --------

       *  Box drawing.

       *  Input function with editing abilities.

       *  Centering lines of text.


                                  Conventions
                                  -----------

          Read the  documentation for  the SCR  package. Screen regions and
     attributes are defined the same way for this package as for SCR. 


                              Available Functions
                              -------------------

     void ScrCenter(int Row, int Col, int Width, char *Text, int Attr);
          This function centers the 'Text' on the specified row. It centers
          the text  in a  region of the specified width which starts at the
          specified column. If the  text  is  longer  than  the  width, the
          first character  of the  text will  start at the specified column
          and the text will  be  truncated.  Note  that  the  text  will be
          displayed  using   the  specified  attribute  regardless  of  the
          attribute already on the screen.

     void ScrDrawBox(
       int Row, int Col, int Width, int Height, int Box_Type, int Attr
       );
          This function draws rectangular  boxes on  the screen.  The width
          and height include the boxes boundary. The box type can be one of
          the following:

               SCR_DBL_LINE        Double line.
               SCR_SNGL_LINE       Single line.

                                                                          1





     SCRTOOLS Documentation                                February 4, 1991

               SCR_DARK_GRAPHIC    Fine graphic.
               SCR_LIGHT_GRAPHIC   Course graphic.
               SCR_SOLID           Solid graphic.
               SCR_ASCII           ASCII characters.
               SCR_BLANK_BOX       Spaces.

          The attribute applies  only  to  the  boundary  of  the  box. The
          interior of the box is unaffected.


     int ScrGets(int Row, int Col, char *Buffer, int Length, int Attr);
          This  function  allows  the  user  to  enter  characters from the
          keyboard. The cursor is moved to the specified row and column and
          any initial  contents of  the specified buffer are displayed. The
          function allows the user to enter characters at the keyboard. The
          characters are  displayed using 'Attr'. The characters are placed
          into the buffer which  remains  null  terminated.  There  must be
          space in the buffer for the specified number of characters plus a
          null byte. In other words the buffer must  be Length+1 characters
          long.

          If the  initial buffer contents are longer than length, ScrGets()
          will insert a null byte  into  the  buffer  to  truncate  it. The
          entire buffer  length is  displayed (in  'Attr') to the user. The
          user may edit the string that s/he is  entering according  to the
          following keys.

          HOME           Move cursor to start of buffer.
          END            Move cursor to end of buffer.
          LEFT ARROW     Move cursor to the left one position in buffer.
          RIGHT ARROW    Move cursor to the right one position in buffer.
          BACKSPACE      Delete character to left of cursor. Close gap.
          DEL            Delete character under cursor. Close gap.
          Cntrl-PGUP     Erases buffer.
          Cntrl-PGDWN    Erases buffer.
          Normal key     Insert character.

          When the  user is  satisfied, s/he  can strike  the return key to
          exit the function. The  return key  can be  used with  the cursor
          anywhere in the buffer. A '\n' character is not inserted when the
          user strikes the return key. In addition, the  user can terminate
          by striking  the ESC  key. In this case, the original contents of
          the buffer are returned to the calling program. Finally, the user
          can terminate by striking the TAB key. The effect in this case is
          identical with that of the return key.

          The function ignores as  many  illegal  things  as  it  can. Only
          printable   characters   (true   ASCII  characters  that  satisfy
          isprint()) are allowed in the buffer. Control-C is ignored during
          the input).

                                                                          2

          The function returns either K_RETURN, K_ESC, or K_TAB (as defined
          in get_key.h) depending on which method was used to terminate.
