          This program accepts a C/C++ language source file through its
          standard input and examines it for problems with {}, (), and []
          nesting. It will print the program, with messages, to its
          standard output.

          The program prints a warning message after each '}' that closes
          off a function (or file scoped struct declaration or initialized
          array). It prints error messages for several type of mismatched
          {}, (), and [] errors. The messages are printed as close to the
          source of the error as possible (the actual error will always be
          above the message). The messages are in bold. This requires that
          ANSI.SYS be installed.

          The program notices unclosed comments, literals, or {...} pairs
          at the end of the file. The message produced by the program may
          be more useful than the "Unexpected EOF" message produced by many
          compilers.

          The program correctly disregards material inside of comments or
          literals. This includes many "pathalogical" examples missed by
          other public domain programs. It understands both C and C++
          comments.

          This program is placed into the public domain by its author,
          Peter Chapin. I welcome comments or bug reports. I can be reached
          as in
