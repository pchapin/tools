TEXTSCAN
========

This program scans the text files specified and reports on various
unusual aspects of those files. In particular, it notes odd control
characters and non ASCII characters (ie characters with their most
significant bits set), white space at the end of lines, and an
"unterminated" line at the end of the file.

This program assumes that a "proper" text file contains only ASCII 0x20
to 0x7E, '\n' (newline), and '\t' (tab) characters. If any other
characters appear in the file, they are noted. The program takes no
corrective action of any kind; the input file(s) are not changed.

Under MS-DOS, the program will take the CR/LF pair at the end of each
line to be a single "new line" character (the program was written in C).
Thus the total number of characters found, as shown in the summary
report, will be less than the number of bytes in the file, as shown in
the directory listing. If there is a large difference, it implies that a
^Z was found in the file before the true end of file.

The program was designed to scan whole groups of files. Thus it accepts
wildcards on the command line. The name of each file is echoed to the
output so that a meaningful report can be generated using I/O
redirection.

          Usage:
          textscan infile [infile...]
