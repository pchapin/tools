Introduction
************

     This document tells you how to use "roff", a text formatting
program.  Roff is a program in the spirit of the unix nroff text
formatter.  The program allows nice looking documents to be produced
with using a word processor and thus dealing with the word processor's
special file format. 

     This particular formatter lacks many of the features expected of a
commercial word processor (and the full nroff formatter).  Nevertheless,
it contains features useful in producing software documentation.  It is
nice to be able to edit such documentation using a text editor while
editing the software itself in a different window.  This is the intended
usage of this program. 

     The roff program accepts a file of text interspersed with
formatting commands.  These commands reside on a line by themselves and
always start with a "." character.  Immediately after the dot is the two
character (lower case) name of the command.  The roff program produces
an output file which contains the formatted text with all the commands
stripped.  The output file can then be printed using an editor or the
DOS type command.

ROFF  Commands
**************

     Roff commands are instructions to the roff program telling the
program how to arrange text on a page.  Any line which begins with a
period in the first column is assumed to be a command line.  Roff
commands all consist of two letters which immediately follow the
beginning period.  Unknown commands, as well as commands in upper case,
are ignored.  You can translate commands to upper case if you want to
temporarily disable a command: they won't be recognized. 

     Most commands can accept arguments.  If the argument is preceded by
a plus or minus sign, then the argument changes the internal value by
the argument amount.  Otherwise, the internal value is set to the value
of the argument.  For example, the command .ls 2 sets the line spacing
to 2, while the command .ls +2 increases the line spacing by 2 lines. 

     Here is a list of the roff commands.  It is assumed you have some
experience using similar text formatters because the description of what
these commands do is sketchy.

ROFF Command Summary
********************

 Command     Break?     Default     Action
 ----------  ---------  ----------  --------------------------
 .bp         yes                    Begin next page
 .br         yes                    Cause break
 .ce n       yes        n=1         Center next n lines
 .cm         no                     Comment
 .fi         yes                    Start fill mode (default)
 .fo         no         empty       Footer title
 .he         no         empty       Header title
 .in n       no         n=0         Indent n spaces
 .ls n       no         n=1         Set line spacing=n
 .nf         yes                    Stop fill mode
 .pl n       no         n=66        Set page length=n
 .rm n       no         n=60        Set right margin=n
 .sp n       yes        n=1         Space down n lines
 .ti n       yes        n=0         Temp indent n spaces
.fi

     A break stops the filling of the current line.  Breaks are needed
between paragraphs.  Lines containing nothing but blanks always cause
one blank line to be output. 

     A line which starts with a tab or blank causes the temporary indent
setting to be set to the number of beginning spaces on that line.  Note
that this feature overrides any .ti setting in effect.  Additionally,
this causes a break to occur.  Thus a line starting with blanks or a tab
will force a new paragraph.

How To Run This Program
***********************

     To run this program just type "roff" followed by a filename.  The
formatted output is writin to standard output.  If no filename is
specified, the input is taken from standard input.  This allows roff to
be used at the end of pipe if desired.
